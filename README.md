## Laera
Data structures are an essential topic when it comes to computer science and software engineering. Pupils and students need a practical application where they can learn and practice efficiently the concepts and the various operations of data structures.

Laera is an Android m-learning application for data structures designed to be a tool of help for pupils and students. The application consists of two main parts: the learning part, where the most popular data structures (e.g., linked lists, arrays, trees, graphs, etc.) are well explained; and the exercising part, giving the user the possibility to test their knowledge gathered in the learning part, by solving practical exercises, where they need to apply the properties for a particular data structure. Exercises, as well as quizzes, track the progress of the user, which can be seen in the Profile section in form of visual charts, showing the topics where the user is getting better score and the topics where the user is not performing as expected.

In the part dedicated for learning, the user can go through lessons that are divided into chapters. After finishing a lesson, the user can evaluate himself by taking a quiz with questions regarding the topic of the lesson. Laera has numerous learning sections divided into chapters and the progress and score of each user is saved in their user account. To make the learning process more competitive, each topic has a leaderboard, which is updated in real-time.

The application supports user login with Google account; by pressing a single
button the user is registered in the database with all the information needed.

Admins can manipulate the database through the dedicated admin view in the
application.
