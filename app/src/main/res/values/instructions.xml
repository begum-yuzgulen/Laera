In order to correctly solve the exercise, you have to press on the nodes of the generated binary tree using the selected traversal order.
By pressing on a node, it will appear under the binary tree, after the last pressed node. If you change your mind, you can press on the node from
the area under the binary tree, which will result in deleting the node.

    <string name="btRotationInst">
In order to correctly solve the exercise, you have to drag the nodes into the drop areas and construct the rotated tree from the
randomly generated binary tree on the top of the page.

    <string name="redBlackTreeInst">
In order to correctly solve the exercise, you have to identify the insertion case and perform the needed operation by dragging
the nodes into the drop areas. Initially, the nodes that can be dragged are colored in the same color as in the generated binary tree. After dropping a node,
you can click on it to change the nodeâ€™s color.
